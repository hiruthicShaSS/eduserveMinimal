## Idea

This is a mobile app for karunyans to help get their student information without going to [Eduserve portal](https://eduserve.karunya.edu/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) every time.
The reason to create this app is to view the student data in a good way unlike the website that is not a mobile resposive and to eliminate the need to login every single god-damn time. 

## Contribution

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Anyone with intermediate experience with flutter can contribute to the project without any guidance, but If you need any assistance on how the project is structured please create an [issue](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/issues) and I will explain. UI designers are really in need and even if you dont know flutter you are welsome to [discuss](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/discussions) with us with wireframes or mockups.

## Getting started

You can download the latest app from the [releases](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/releases) tab.

If you want to build the app for yourself then you will need flutter installed on your device. [Install flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
Once it is installed follow these steps to compile an app from the source,

### Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hiruthic2002/eduserveMinimal.git
   git checkout mobile_app
   ```
   You dont have to check out to the mobile_app branch, the main branch will contain the code for stable version. Although you can always update your [mobile_app](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/tree/mobile_app) branch to your local repo for dev versions of the app.

### Build app

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk
   ```

   - Platform specific:

     ```bash
     flutter build apk --target-platform "your platform"
     ```

   - Append '--release' or '--debug' for release app or debug app respectively.
