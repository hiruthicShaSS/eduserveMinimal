## Idea

This is a mobile app for karunyans to help get their student information without going to [Eduserve portal](https://eduserve.karunya.edu/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) every time.
The reason to create this app is to view the student data in a good way unlike the website that is not a mobile responsive and to eliminate the need to login every single god-damn time.
