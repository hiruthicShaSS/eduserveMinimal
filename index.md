## eduserveMinimal

<!-- You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. -->

### Idea

This is a mobile app for karunyans to help get their student information without going to [Eduserve portal](https://eduserve.karunya.edu/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) every time.
The reason to create this app is to view the student data in a good way unlike the website that is not a mobile resposive and to eleminate the need to login every single god-damn time. 

### Contribution
Anyone with intermediate experience with flutter can contribute to the project without any guide, but If you need any assistance on how the project is structured please create an [issue](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/issues) and I will explain. UI designers are really in need and even if you dont know flutter you are welsome to [discuss](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/discussions) with us with wireframes or mockups.

### Getting started
You can download the latest app from the [releases](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/releases) tab.

If you want to build the app for yourself then you will need flutter installed on your device. [Install flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
Once it is installed follow these steps to compile an app from the source,

1. ### Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hiruthic2002/eduserveMinimal.git
   git checkout mobile_app
   ```
   You dont have to check out to the mobile_app branch, the main branch will contain the code for stable version. Although you can always update your [mobile_app](https://github.com/hiruthicShaSS/eduserveMinimal/tree/mobile_app) branch to your local repo for dev versions of the app.

2. ### Build app

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk
   ```

   - Platform specific:

     ```bash
     flutter build apk --target-platform "your platform"
     ```

   - Append '--release' or '--debug' for release app or debug app respectively.
