Minimalist app for eduserve

This branch contains the code for scrapping eduserve and upload the data to cloud.
This script uses Google Drive to sync the data with mobile app.

## Setup

1. ### Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hiruthic2002/eduserveMinimal.git
   git checkout scrapper
   ```

2. ### Run the script

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```

    **Google Drive method:**

    This script require client_secret.json file which can be attained from [Google Developer Console](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40136699/using-google-api-for-python-where-do-i-get-the-client-secrets-json-file-from). If you have dedicated cloud storage please use that, with GDrive you need to give permission every time the script executes.

    *If you are gonna use different storage solution you dont need this step and you can modify the code on the file [eduserve.py](/eduserve.py) below the 'upload' function*

    *This create's a file called 'datadump.json' which contains the eduserve data.*
    *This is a one time process*

    - Uplodad this file to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.comdrive/u/0/my-drive).
    - Right click on the uploaded file and click 'Get link' and change the access to 'Anyone with the link' and copy the link.
